# Realtime Handwritten Digit Recognizer

# Project Overview
This project aims to build a model which can recognize handwritten digits, from zero to nine, in realtime; the input video is captured using an external camera.<br>
I built different deep learning models with Pytorch to find out the best one.
I also used OpenCV to preprocessing video to let the model easier to recognize. 

# Data Description

Because of limited computational resources, the dataset only contains 42,000 gray-scale images. Each image is 28x28. For more information, access this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)

# Result
Some results can be found in [result folder](https://github.com/leminhviett/Realtime-Digit-Recognizer/tree/master/result).

# What I have learnt
- Popular layers used in computer vision such as CONV, MAXPOOL, etc
- Preprocessing video with OpenCV
- Implement model with Pytorch
